Game: Jewel Juggler
By: Charlotte Shores

How To Play: 

The goal of the game is to create 3-matches. You do this by holding down on the mouse and lifting up where
you would like to change gems. If you make a match of bombs, or a match next to a bomb this will get you even more points and a 
large explosion! 

If you happen to run out of matches on the board, press the 'S' key to shuffle!

You only have 60 seconds to get the most points you can! Once the game finishes, you will know how many stars you recieved.

Enjoy! 


I was able to get my Assets for my gems from a Udemy Module at the link https://www.udemy.com/course/unitypuzzle/
The assets I Imported included various boxes, gems, and a bomb that I was able to incorporate into my project
